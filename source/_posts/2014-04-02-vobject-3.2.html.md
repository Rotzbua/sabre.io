We just released sabre/vobject 3.2.0. This release is backwards compatible
with the 3.1.* series.

New features:

* We are now fully [hhvm][1] compatible. If you're running a recent hhvm
  version, everything should work as expected. From this point forward, we
  will also actively support hhvm.
* The validator now understands a lot more validation rules. So using it now,
  either with the API, or on the command-line, should yield a lot more
  information.
* Support for a range of new timezone identifiers.
* Support for additional vcard properties from [rfc6715][2] and [rfc6474][3].
* Added a [UUID][4] utility, for easily generating unique strings for use in
  `UID` properties.
* Support for `BYMONTH` on `DAILY` recurrences.
* Automatically fix broken vcards from Google's CardDAV server.

We hope you like it! To upgrade with composer, make sure that your
`composer.json` has a line that says:

    "sabre/vobject" : "~3.2"

And then run:

    composer update sabre/vobject

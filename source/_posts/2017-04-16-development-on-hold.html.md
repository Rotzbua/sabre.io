Hi there! My name is Evert, and for the past 10 years I've probably done
around 90-95% of development for the [sabre/*][2] packages, and took over 
[Baikal][3] development last year.

After this time, it all became a little bit too much for me to maintain
these. I [wrote a blog post][1] about this. This post is a follow-up that I'm
cross-posting on both my own blog and sabre.io.

I want to start with a THANK YOU! So many people have written in with support
and understanding, and told me about how these libraries have helped them out
in the past. It was heartwarming and also bittersweet.

Support for sabre/* and Baikal
------------------------------

I was asked what's going to happen with future support for these projects. If
you read my post, the only answer I can give you is: "I don't know".

I'm no longer doing maintenance aside from an occasional bugfix when I feel
like it, but I'm no longer giving any guarantees. It's really completely up to
you.

If you're a corporation and rely on the sabre/* projects, and you're also willing
to invest in this, [drop me a line][4]. If there's a few businesses like yours,
it might just be enough to setup a small foundation and hire a person to
continue working on this and I'm willing to help in setting this up.

So far there's been no serious offers of this sort, so your best bet might be
to understand the sabre/* source (it's not as hard as you think) and treat the
same way as in-house developed code.

A few have offered to just pay me to work on specific things. I appreciate
this, but one-off projects don't make a lot of sense for me and one of my
biggest issues has always been finding time, not money.

For those of you that are developers and interested in taking over maintenance,
I would just want to say: do it! You don't need my permission or blessing.

The packages are on github, you can submit pull requests and there's also lots
of open, unanswered support questions. If over time the quality of your
contributions is high, I'm super open to just hand over control of the 
repositories you're interested in.

Someone also asked "is there going to be a fork?", which I found a hilarious
question to receive because obviously I wouldn't be very interested in this
idea. If you're thinking of forking though, consider the fact that you can also
contribute to the main project and benefit from the positive reputation the
project already has.

Some small next steps
---------------------

At this point I shut down the mailing list and the comments section on
sabre.io. Support questions come in through both of these channels, and without
anyone to monitor these, it seems better that they're gone. Go to github, there's
more eyes there.

I'm also turning off github notifications for all of these projects. If you
really need to get a hold of me, email me or mention `@evert` on github.

Perhaps in time someone else will post
a happy update here announcing a new maintainer and renewed interest.

Until then, I'm sorry I'm letting you down and thanks to the hundreds of people
that have supported me! Keep an eye on [evertpot.com][5] if you're curious
what I'm up to next!

We just released sabre/dav 3.2.0.
This is a major new version, and we're very excited to bring you features
we've been working on since last winter.

Highlights from this release:

* Support for [PSR-3][3] for logging.
* Full support for [PostgreSQL][4]. We require version 9.5.
* We're now supporting WebDAV resource sharing.
* Calendar sharing now works out of the box!

If you're curious, there's a much larger list of features on the
[ChangeLog][1]. If you are upgrading from an older version, be sure to take
a look at the [upgrade instructions][5], as we've made a few backwards
compatibility breaks in order to support the new features.

To get started right away, you can find a zip on the [releases][2] page.

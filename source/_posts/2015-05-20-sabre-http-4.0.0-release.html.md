We just released sabre/http 4.0.0

This version contains a few new features and some cleanups. We suspect that it
will work as a drop-in replacement for nearly anyone.

New features:

* Functions for content-negotiations
* Support for parsing the HTTP `Prefer` header. ([RFC7240][1]) 
* Now integrates functions from [sabre/uri][2].
* Functions for parsing mime-type strings such as `Content-Type.`

Upgrade sabre/http by making sure your `composer.json` has `~4.0` as a version
requirement, and then just run `composer update`.

Full changelog of this release can be found on [Github][3].

While the API is compatible with 3.x, some functions have moved and the old
ones are deprecated. Read more in the [upgrade instructions][4].

We just released sabre/http 5.0.0

* Now requires PHP 7.0+
* Supports sabre/event 4.x and 5.x
* Depends on sabre/uri 2.
* hhvm is no longer supported starting this release.
* It's now possible to supply request/response bodies using a callback function. This allows very high-speed/low-memory responses to be created.
* Strict typing is used everywhere this is applicable.
* Removed `URLUtil` class. It was deprecated a long time ago, and most of its functions moved to the `sabre/uri` package.
* Removed `Util` class. Most of its functions moved to the functions.php file.
* The `$method` and `$uri` arguments when constructing a Request object are now required.
* When `Sapi::getRequest()` is called, we default to setting the HTTP Method to CLI.
* The HTTP response is now initialized with HTTP code `500` instead of `null`, so if it's not changed, it will be emitted as 500.
* `Sending charset="UTF-8" on Basic authentication challenges per [RFC7617][1].
* Added support for `SERVER_PROTOCOL HTTP/2.0`
* Previous CURL opts are not persisted anymore
* Final release

Upgrade sabre/http by making sure your `composer.json` has `~5.0` as a version
requirement, and then just run `composer update`.
